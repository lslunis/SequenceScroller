# Sequence Scroller
Sequence Scroller is a Chrome extension that attempts to navigate to the previous or next page in a sequence whenever you attempt to scroll above the top or below the bottom of the current page.

If the page contains rel=prev or rel=next links, the first one will be used. Otherwise, if the url of the current page contains something that looks like a page number, it will be modified.
